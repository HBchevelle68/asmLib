Ubuntu Linux

# asmLib
Sucessful Tests:
- Text file
- 4k image
- 1GB .db file

Felt like doing a challenging project to help teach myself 64-bit assembly. Simplistic file server and client, in PURE assembly no C externals used

Some notes:

- Server manganges its own dynamic memory growth and cleaning
- portable lib files for use in other projects
