Ubuntu Linux

# asmLib
Sucessful Tests:
- Text file
- 4k image
- 1GB .db file

### Felt like doing a challenging project to help teach myself 64-bit assembly. Straightforward file server and client, in PURE assembly no C externals used

# Some notes:

- Server and client each mangange their own dynamic memory growth and cleaning
- Portable lib files for use in other projects
- Utlizes only system calls.
